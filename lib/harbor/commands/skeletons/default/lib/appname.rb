    # For example, you might set config.connection_string in your config,
    # allowing you to overwrite it multiple times for different environments,
    # but you only actually want to initialize a database connection once,
    # so Sequel::connect(config.connection_string) would go in here.

    # This method will be called when Harbor.new is called.
